## Populate listbox when dropdownlist changed with Knockout JS
This is a demo that populates a listbox when a dropdownlist changes, using Knockout JS and ASP.NET Core 3.1.

## Prerequisites
- To install knockout js in  the .Net Core web application, I used [LibMan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/libman-vs?view=aspnetcore-3.1);
- The database was created using the EF Core Migrations feature;

## Expected result
